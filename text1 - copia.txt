Take me for a ride
I'm the one you pushed aside
But it's coming back to you
Yeah it's coming back to you

Run to the sound
Take it back and double down
'Cause it's coming back to you
Yeah, it's coming back to you

Well, ah-ah-ah well we're pouring gasoline
So dance around the fire that we once believed in
Ah-ah-ah It'll never be the same, now

'Cause there's nothing left for us to be
Give it up the champions of greed
So come around and have another round on me

Dance fucker dance, let the motherfucker burn

Snake's in the grass while you are living in the past
Say what're you gonna do?
Yeah what're you gonna do?
Earn never learn
When you're cheering while it burns
Yeah we're coming after you
Yeah we're coming after you

Slim pickens well he does the right thing
And he rides the bomb to hell
Yeah he rides the bomb to hell
Watch the pulse, it quickens after every little sting
If you're gonna go to hell
Drinking up you might as well

Are you really gonna take it like that?
Riding on a missle with a cowboy hat, and

Ah-ah-ah well the world is gonna end
So dance around the fire that we once believed in
Ah-ah-ah Wanna tear it down again, now

'Cause there's nothing left for us to be
Give it up the sons of anarchy
So come around and have another round on me

Dance fucker dance, let the motherfucker burn!

Are you really gonna take it like that?
Riding on the missle with the baseball bat, and

Ah-ah-ah well we're pouring gasoline
So dance around the fire that we once believed in
Ah-ah-ah It'll never be the same
The takers and the liers that we all believed in

Ah-ah-ah well we're going down in flames
So dance around the fire
We dance around the fire

'Cause it's never left for us to be
Give it up the champions of grief
So come around and have another round on me

Hey! Hey!

Dance fucker Dance, let the motherfucker burn!
